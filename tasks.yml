- 80 0 bug - Matt's example from raw.githubusercontent renders external links that don't work
- 80 2 mark myself & save my URIs and build functions to relate-to-me
- 80 0 add the otherLocations to children (so they can show links in the UI)
- 80 0 try resourceId as an index into the current URI (since the resource URIs are now permissioned)
- 80 1 click on a 4th-gen person and force further expansion

  : - 90 1 handle when load success after save failure or vice versa

- 75 0 use logger instead of console.log
- 75 0 handle more task YAML variations (eg. blocked & child issues)
