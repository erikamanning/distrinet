- 90 1 add tests: find, globalUriForResource, globalUriForId

- 80 0 try resourceId as an index into the current URI (since the resource URIs are now permissioned)
- 80 1 click on a 4th-gen person and force further expansion
- 80 1 tests - missing settings dir & file, missing cache dir, missing URLs, multiple OK files
  - 90 1 handle when load success after save failure or vice versa
- 80 1 give example of gedcomx protocol
- 80 0 load cached files into memory (eg. all < 5 MB)

- 75 0 use logger instead of console.log
- 75 0 handle more task YAML variations (eg. blocked & child issues)
